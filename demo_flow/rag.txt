ðŸ“š Knowledge Base â€” Organizational Standards for Jira Stories
1. AWS Network Changes â€” Cloud Networking Team

Scope: VPC, subnets, route tables, security groups, NACLs, ENIs, load balancers, Direct Connect, TGW, VPN, PrivateLink.

Implementation Policies

Design Approval: All network changes must have an approved HLD (high-level design) reviewed by Cloud Networking.

Least Privilege: Only open required ports/protocols from the smallest possible CIDR range.

CIDR Allocation: Follow reserved CIDR allocation sheet; no overlap with other VPCs unless explicitly peered.

Redundancy: Maintain HA by distributing resources across at least 2 AZs.

Documentation: Every change must include updated network diagrams.

Validation Policies

Confirm route propagation and route table updates are correct.

Verify no unintended CIDR exposure (e.g., 0.0.0.0/0 unless approved).

Confirm SG/NACL rules match the requested flow only.

Ensure all ENIs are attached to the correct subnets.

Test Case Standards

Perform connectivity test (ping, curl, or application-level) between affected endpoints.

Validate failover works by simulating AZ failure where applicable.

Check CloudWatch VPC flow logs for expected traffic patterns and no unexpected rejects.

2. AWS Security Changes â€” Security Team

Scope: IAM, KMS, SG, NACL, WAF, Shield, security configurations in services.

Implementation Policies

Least Privilege Principle: Grant only permissions strictly required for the service/user.

Security Review: Security team sign-off required for all public exposure (Internet Gateway, public LB listeners).

Encryption: Enforce encryption in transit (TLS â‰¥ 1.2) and at rest (KMS CMKs).

Logging: Enable CloudTrail and relevant security service logging.

Validation Policies

Ensure IAM policies pass static analysis (no "*" in Resource unless justified).

Validate KMS key policies grant correct principal access only.

Check WAF rules are deployed to correct ALB/NLB/CloudFront distributions.

Confirm SG and NACL rules follow corporate templates.

Test Case Standards

Attempt access with unauthorized credentials â€” should fail.

Attempt access from unauthorized IP ranges â€” should fail.

Test key encryption/decryption with sample payloads.

3. AWS Testing Standards â€” QA/Testing Team

Scope: Functional, performance, regression testing for infrastructure changes.

Implementation Policies

Prepare test plan before implementation; align with business acceptance criteria.

Include rollback testing in plan (verify rollback restores prior state).

Include performance impact assessment for new network/security configs.

Validation Policies

Verify test cases cover all acceptance criteria.

Validate test results are documented and stored in Jira as attachments.

Confirm no adverse impact to unrelated workloads during tests.

Test Case Standards

Regression: Confirm existing flows remain functional.

Functional: Confirm new connectivity, security, or service configurations behave as expected.

Load/Stress: Test under peak expected load.

4. Change Management â€” Change Advisory Board (CAB)

Scope: All production-affecting changes.

Implementation Policies

Change Window: Schedule during approved maintenance windows.

Stakeholder Notification: Notify impacted teams â‰¥ 48 hours before change.

Rollback Plan: Must be explicit and tested in non-prod.

Approval Workflow: CAB approval required before execution in production.

Validation Policies

Confirm all approvals logged in change management tool.

Verify implementation matches the approved scope.

Ensure rollback steps are executable without additional approvals.

Test Case Standards

Post-change smoke test of all affected services.

Verify monitoring/alerting triggers for new components.

Check all logging/observability dashboards reflect the updated architecture.

5. Jira Story Template Mapping

Every Jira story generated by the GenAI tool should include:

Summary: Clear, actionable title.

Description: Context, rationale, affected systems, dependencies.

Implementation Steps: Auto-filled from policies (network/security/test/change mgmt).

Validation Steps: Derived from Validation Policies.

Test Cases: Explicit, mapped to acceptance criteria.

Rollback Plan: Step-by-step, validated in lower environment.

Approvals Needed: List of teams/roles who must approve.

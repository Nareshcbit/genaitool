Prompt to Q — Part 5: Concrete Upsert Patterns (Neptune openCypher + NetworkX)

Role: You are a senior graph platform engineer. Produce production-ready upsert patterns for loading AWS network/security inventory (from Parts 1–2) into:

Option A: Amazon Neptune (openCypher compatible)

Option B: In-memory NetworkX graphs (Python)

Your output must include idempotent MERGEs, batching, parameter conventions, deletions, and small worked examples. You must include the exact Cypher snippets provided below, and expand them into full, reusable templates.

Include verbatim (and expand) these Cypher sketches
// Subnet
MERGE (s:Subnet {id:$subnet_id, account:$acct, region:$region})
SET s.cidr=$cidr, s.az=$az, s.private=$is_private;

// RouteTable + association
MERGE (rt:RouteTable {id:$rtb_id, account:$acct, region:$region})
MERGE (s)-[:ASSOCIATED_WITH]->(rt);

// VPC route
MERGE (rt)-[:HAS_ROUTE {
  dest:$dest_cidr, target_type:$target_type, target_id:$target_id, state:$state
}]->(:RoutePlaceholder {id: $rtb_id+"#"+$dest_cidr+"#"+$target_id});

// SG rule (you can also store as properties on SG)
MERGE (sg:SecurityGroup {id:$sg_id, account:$acct, region:$region})
MERGE (sg)-[:HAS_RULE {
  dir:$dir, proto:$proto, low:$low, high:$high, src_kind:$kind, src_value:$value
}]->(:Rule {id: randomUUID()});


And for Option B:

Build G_routing = nx.DiGraph() for L3

Build G_security = structures/functions to evaluate SG/NACL per (src_eni, dst_eni, proto, port, src_ip, dst_ip)

Deliverables (produce all sections)
Section A — IDs & Parameters

Define node ID format: "{accountId}:{region}:{label}:{naturalId}".

Edge uniqueness: (fromId, type, toId, qualifier) (e.g., qualifier = destCidr#targetType#targetId for routes).

Standardize parameter names:

Nodes: $id, $acct, $region, $props (with updatedAt, stateHash, tags).

Edges: $fromId, $toId, $etype, $eprops.

Section B — Neptune openCypher Upserts (Idempotent)

Expand the provided sketches into UNWIND-based batch templates for:

Nodes: VPC, Subnet, RouteTable, InternetGateway, NatGateway, VpcPeering, ENI, EC2Instance, SecurityGroup, NetworkAcl, TransitGateway, TgwAttachment, TgwRouteTable, VpcEndpoint.

Edges:

Subnet-[:ASSOCIATED_WITH]->RouteTable

RouteTable-[:HAS_ROUTE {destCidr,targetType,targetId,state}]->(Target)

ENI-[:PLACED_IN]->Subnet, ENI-[:USES]->SecurityGroup

VPC-[:ATTACHED]->(IGW|NatGateway|VpcPeering|TgwAttachment)

TgwAttachment-[:ASSOCIATED_WITH|PROPAGATES_TO]->TgwRouteTable

TgwRouteTable-[:HAS_ROUTE {destCidr,targetAttachmentId,blackhole}]->TgwAttachment

Subnet-[:ASSOCIATED_WITH]->NetworkAcl

Ensure MERGE keys are stable and SET includes updatedAt, stateHash.

Provide an example batch:

UNWIND $subnetRows AS row
MERGE (s:Subnet {id: row.id, account: row.acct, region: row.region})
SET s += row.props;


Show ordering (create nodes, then edges) and retry guidance for late targets.

Section C — NetworkX Upserts (Python)

Provide typed helpers:

from typing import TypedDict, Dict, Any
import networkx as nx

class NodeRow(TypedDict):
    id: str; type: str; acct: str; region: str; props: Dict[str, Any]

class EdgeRow(TypedDict):
    fromId: str; toId: str; type: str; props: Dict[str, Any]

G_l3 = nx.DiGraph()  # routing
# L4 uses side dicts (SG/NACL) rather than edges


Implement upsert_node(G, row) and upsert_edge(G, row) that align to the JSONL from Part 2.

Show how HAS_ROUTE edges carry {destCidr,targetType,targetId,state} and how to store TGW associations/propagations.

Section D — JSONL → Parameter Mapping

Define exact JSONL shapes for nodes and edges (consistent with Parts 1–2).

Map JSONL fields to Cypher parameters and NetworkX attributes.

Include example rows for:

Subnet, RouteTable, NatGateway, ENI, SecurityGroup

Edges: ASSOCIATED_WITH, HAS_ROUTE, PLACED_IN, USES

Section E — Deletions / Tombstones

Strategy 1 (preferred): mark disposition="DELETED" on nodes and soft-delete edges; separate compactor job.

Strategy 2: emit DELETE_NODE / DELETE_EDGE JSONL.

Provide Cypher and NetworkX delete snippets.

Section F — Worked Example (Tiny)

Input JSONL (3–6 rows) → show:

Create Subnet s-a, RouteTable rt-a, NatGateway nat-1

Edge s-a → rt-a (ASSOCIATED_WITH), route rt-a —HAS_ROUTE→ nat-1 (0.0.0.0/0)

ENI eni-x in s-a, eni-x —USES→ sg-1

Provide the exact Cypher batches and NetworkX calls; show a quick verification query and Python check.

Section G — Guardrails & Performance Tips

Dedupe HAS_ROUTE by (rtbId,destCidr,targetType,targetId).

Keep edge props minimal & typed.

Batch size guidance (e.g., 500–2,000 per UNWIND); exponential backoff on transient errors.

Prefer loading targets first, or queue edges to DLQ and replay.

Acceptance Criteria

Includes the verbatim Cypher snippets above, expanded into reusable UNWIND templates.

Upserts are idempotent and align with Part-1 IDs & Part-2 JSONL shapes.

NetworkX helpers rebuild the same topology from the same JSONL.

Clear deletion/tombstone approach.

Worked example runs end-to-end without missing references.

Deliverables: Return Sections A–G fully, with code blocks ready to paste.

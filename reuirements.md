1) Canonical graph schema - a
Node types (with key properties)

VPC: vpc_id, cidr, dns_hostnames, dns_support

InternetGateway: igw_id

NatGateway: natgw_id, eip

TransitGateway: tgw_id

Edge types (directional)

Subnet -> RouteTable (ASSOCIATED_WITH)

RouteTable -> Route (HAS_ROUTE)

Route -> (IGW|NAT|ENI|PCX|TGWATTACH|VPCE) (TARGETS)

Subnet -> NetworkAcl (ASSOCIATED_WITH)

ENI -> Subnet (PLACED_IN)

ENI -> SecurityGroup (USES)

EC2 -> ENI (ATTACHED)

VPC -> InternetGateway (ATTACHED)

VPC -> VpcPeering (PARTICIPATES)

VPC -> TgwAttachment (ATTACHED)

TgwAttachment -> TransitGateway (ATTACHED_TO)

TgwRouteTable -> TgwRoute (HAS_ROUTE)

TransitGateway -> TgwRouteTable (ASSOCIATED/PROPAGATION)

TgwAttachment -> TgwRouteTable (ASSOCIATED_WITH / PROPAGATES_TO)

IDs: use natural IDs + (account_id, region) as compound key.
You can store Route and SgRule as edge properties instead of nodes if you prefer a lighter model.

2) ETL: Map your “Describe*” data → graph

Create lightweight Athena views (or directly from your Parquet) that already look like graph upserts:

VPC / Subnet / ENI

describe-vpcs → VPC nodes

describe-subnets (+ your “private/public” derivation) → Subnet nodes; Subnet -> RouteTable (main) needs describe-route-tables.associations

describe-network-interfaces → ENI nodes + ENI -> Subnet, ENI -> SG

Route tables (VPC layer)

describe-route-tables → RouteTable nodes + HAS_ROUTE edges with props {dest_cidr, target_type, target_id}

Normalize targets:

gatewayId → IGW or VGW

natGatewayId → NAT

instanceId/networkInterfaceId → ENI

vpcPeeringConnectionId → PCX

transitGatewayId → TGW‑ATTACH (resolve which attach belongs to the same VPC)

NACLs

describe-network-acls → NetworkAcl nodes + NetworkAclRule children (or edge props), and Subnet -> Nacl

Security groups

describe-security-groups → SecurityGroup nodes + SgRule children (or edge props)

Gateways & peering

describe-internet-gateways

describe-nat-gateways

describe-vpc-peering-connections

TGW

describe-transit-gateways → TGW nodes

describe-transit-gateway-attachments → TgwAttachment nodes; link to VPC and TGW

describe-transit-gateway-route-tables → TgwRouteTable nodes

get-transit-gateway-route-table-associations → edges TgwAttachment -> TgwRouteTable (ASSOCIATED_WITH)

get-transit-gateway-route-table-propagations → edges (TgwAttachment) -[PROPAGATES_TO]-> (TgwRouteTable)

search-transit-gateway-routes → TgwRoute entries with dest_cidr, target_attachment_id, blackhole

Endpoints

describe-vpc-endpoints (interface/gateway), include their SGs for interface endpoints.

Keep updated_at and state_hash for idempotent upserts into your graph store (Neptune or your in‑memory builder).

3) Build two graphs: L3 routing graph and L4 filter graph

You will get simpler, correct results by separating concerns:

A) L3 “routing” graph (IP‑reachability ignoring SG/NACL)

Vertices: Subnet, Gateway types (IGW/NAT/VPCe), TgwAttachment, TgwRouteTable, VpcPeering, ENI (optional for instance‑level)
Edges:

From Subnet → RouteTable (main or associated) (logical edge)

RouteTable --HAS_ROUTE(dest, target)--> Target (where Target is IGW/NAT/ENI/PCX/TGWATTACH/VPCE)

For TGW layer:

TgwAttachment --ASSOCIATED_WITH--> TgwRouteTable

TgwAttachment --PROPAGATES_TO--> TgwRouteTable

TgwRouteTable --HAS_ROUTE(dest, target_attachment)

Derived edges: allow a hop from one TgwAttachment to another if the source attachment propagates to the route table that routes to the target attachment.

For Peering:

Derived edges between route in VPC‑A to PCX AND route in VPC‑B to PCX (respect asymmetric routes).

Edge condition (per packet): dest_ip ∈ dest_cidr and state != blackhole.
You’ll evaluate this during path search; you can also pre‑index routes by prefix to speed lookup.

B) L4 “filter” graph (stateful/stateless checks)

For each hop between ENIs (or subnet boundary), you must pass both:

Security Groups (stateful):

Egress on source ENI’s SGs allow (proto, port, dst [cidr or sg-ref])

Ingress on destination ENI’s SGs allow (proto, port, src [cidr or sg-ref])

SG‑to‑SG references should be resolved into ENI sets or stored as SG‑ID edges.

NACLs (stateless):

Subnet’s NACL ingress allows from src to dst (proto/ports)

Subnet’s NACL egress allows the return path (or at least forward, depending on how strict you model; AWS requires both directions)

You can compute an effective decision for a specific tuple (src_ip, dst_ip, proto, port) on the fly during path confirmation.

4) Path evaluation algorithm (inter‑VPC EC2→EC2 example via TGW)

Given: source EC2 i-a (pick its primary ENI/IP) in VPC‑A:Subnet‑A, destination EC2 i-b in VPC‑B:Subnet‑B, tuple (proto=tcp, port=443).

Phase 1 — Candidate L3 paths

Identify src_subnet and dst_subnet from ENIs.

BFS/Dijkstra over the routing graph with dynamic route matching:

From src_subnet → follow association to its RouteTable → expand zero or more HAS_ROUTE edges whose dest_cidr matches dst_ip or lead toward TGW/PCX/IGW/NAT that could carry us nearer.

If hitting TGWATTACH(A): step into TGW domain:

Find the associated TGW route table for that attachment.

From that table, pick routes whose dest_cidr matches dst_subnet.cidr (or a supernet) and whose target_attachment_id equals TGWATTACH(B) (the attachment of VPC‑B).

Only allow that edge if TGWATTACH(A) propagates into that route table (or VPC‑A routes were manually statically added).

From TGWATTACH(B) back to VPC‑B: you must find a route in VPC‑B’s route table that points to the TGW for traffic destined to dst_ip (asymmetric routing is common; if missing, mark unreachable).

Collect all minimal paths that end at dst_subnet.

A valid L3 path for TGW case typically looks like:

ENI-A → Subnet-A → RouteTable-A → (route: dst_ip ∈ 10.20.0.0/16 → tgw-attach-A)
tgw-attach-A → (assoc) tgw-rt-1 → (route: 10.20.0.0/16 → tgw-attach-B)
tgw-attach-B → VPC-B RouteTable-B (has route to local subnets) → Subnet-B → ENI-B

Phase 2 — L4 confirmation (SG/NACL)

For the chosen path, evaluate the data plane between the concrete endpoints:

Source SG egress on ENI‑A allows (tcp, 443, dst_ip) AND/OR (tcp, 443, SG‑of‑ENI‑B) if you model SG‑refs.

Destination SG ingress on ENI‑B allows (tcp, 443, src_ip|src_sg).

NACLs on Subnet‑A (egress) and Subnet‑B (ingress) allow the tuple; if you model return traffic, verify reverse ports as well.

If the L3 path passes but L4 fails, report blocked with the exact rule that denied.

Do the L4 step only for terminal leg ENI‑A ⇄ ENI‑B (and LB ENI if traversed). You don’t need SG/NACL checks inside TGW—those are handled by the TGW’s control plane with route tables only.

5) Concrete upsert patterns (pick a store)
Option A: Neptune (openCypher) upserts (sketch)
// Subnet
MERGE (s:Subnet {id:$subnet_id, account:$acct, region:$region})
SET s.cidr=$cidr, s.az=$az, s.private=$is_private;

// RouteTable + association
MERGE (rt:RouteTable {id:$rtb_id, account:$acct, region:$region})
MERGE (s)-[:ASSOCIATED_WITH]->(rt);

// VPC route
MERGE (rt)-[:HAS_ROUTE {
  dest:$dest_cidr, target_type:$target_type, target_id:$target_id, state:$state
}]->(:RoutePlaceholder {id: $rtb_id+"#"+$dest_cidr+"#"+$target_id});

// SG rule (you can also store as properties on SG)
MERGE (sg:SecurityGroup {id:$sg_id, account:$acct, region:$region})
MERGE (sg)-[:HAS_RULE {
  dir:$dir, proto:$proto, low:$low, high:$high, src_kind:$kind, src_value:$value
}]->(:Rule {id: randomUUID()});

Option B: In‑memory graph (NetworkX) for quick results

Build G_routing = nx.DiGraph() for L3

Build G_security = structures (or functions) to evaluate SG/NACL per (src_eni, dst_eni, proto, port, src_ip, dst_ip)

6) Normalization helpers (Athena views you’ll want)

vw_vpc_routes

One row per route: account, region, vpc_id, rtb_id, src_subnet_id (via association or “ALL via main”), dest_cidr, target_type, target_id, state

vw_tgw_routes

tgw_id, tgw_rt_id, dest_cidr, target_attachment_id, blackhole

vw_tgw_assoc

tgw_attachment_id, tgw_rt_id (associated)

vw_tgw_propagations

tgw_attachment_id, tgw_rt_id (propagates_to)

vw_eni_effective

eni_id, vpc_id, subnet_id, primary_ip, sg_ids[]

vw_sg_rules_expanded

explode SG rules into rows with normalized (dir, proto, port_low, port_high, src_kind, src_value_cidr_or_sg)

vw_nacl_rules_expanded

normalized NACL entries with explicit allow/deny and port ranges

These views make your loaders trivial and your path evaluator deterministic.

7) Return values for your users (what to show)

For any “show path EC2‑A → EC2‑B on tcp/443”:

Decision: reachable or blocked

Path: ordered node IDs (subnets, gateways, tgw attaches, subnets …)

Why: for each hop, include:

Route that matched (rtb_id, dest, target)

SG/NACL rules that allowed/blocked terminal leg (rule numbers/ids, matched predicate)

Then render a subgraph of those nodes/edges using Graphviz/Cytoscape with:

Green edges for allowed; red with tooltip for the first blocking rule.

8) Quick starter: minimal path evaluator (logic outline)
def match_routes(routes, dst_ip):
    # routes: list of {dest_cidr, target_type, target_id, state}
    # return candidates whose dest_cidr contains dst_ip and state!='blackhole'
    ...

def next_hops_from_subnet(subnet, dst_ip):
    rtb = subnet.associated_rtb or subnet.vpc.main_rtb
    return match_routes(rtb.routes, dst_ip)

def tgw_hops(from_attach, dst_cidr):
    # find associated tgw_rt
    rt = assoc_table[from_attach]
    # find routes in rt where dest matches dst_cidr and target_attachment_id points to some attach
    return [attachB for route in rt.routes if ip_in_cidr(dst_cidr, route.dest) and not route.blackhole]

def sg_allows(src_eni, dst_eni, proto, port, src_ip, dst_ip):
    return egress_allows(src_eni.sgs, proto, port, dst_ip) \
        and ingress_allows(dst_eni.sgs, proto, port, src_ip)

def nacl_allows(subnet, dir, proto, port, peer_ip):
    # stateless eval against ordered rule numbers
    ...

def reachable(src_eni, dst_eni, proto, port):
    # Phase 1: find some L3 path using BFS over next_hops_* and TGW logic
    path = find_l3_path(src_eni.subnet, dst_eni.subnet, dst_eni.primary_ip)
    if not path: return False, "No L3 route", None
    # Phase 2: L4 checks at endpoints
    if not sg_allows(src_eni, dst_eni, proto, port, src_eni.primary_ip, dst_eni.primary_ip):
        return False, "Security Group block", path
    if not nacl_allows(src_eni.subnet, "egress", proto, port, dst_eni.primary_ip):
        return False, "NACL egress block", path
    if not nacl_allows(dst_eni.subnet, "ingress", proto, port, src_eni.primary_ip):
        return False, "NACL ingress block", path
    return True, "Reachable", path

9) Sanity checks & edge cases

Asymmetric routes (very common!): require VPC‑B route back to TGW/PCX; otherwise you may see one‑way L3 but real traffic fails (NACLs also stateless).

PrefixLists: resolve into CIDR sets during SG evaluation.

Implicit local routes: every VPC RT has a local route to its own CIDR; include it.

Blackhole TGW routes: treat as terminal blocks.

Interface endpoints: model their SGs and see if source can reach the VPCE ENIs.

ALB/NLB: if traversing an LB, add checks for listener/target‑group port/proto and LB SG rules.

TL;DR

Load VPC, Subnet, RT, Route, IGW/NAT/PCX/TGW, SG, NACL, ENI into a property graph.

Build L3 routing graph + L4 filter evaluators.

For any source/destination, BFS the routing graph with live route matching, then verify SG+NACL on the endpoint leg(s).

Return path + reasons and render a color‑coded diagram.

If you want, I can share a tiny NetworkX/Graphviz sample that ingests a few CSVs (standing in for your views) and emits an inter‑VPC TGW path SVG you can plug into your UI.

Give me prompt for Q to do step 1 ( Canonical graph schema)
ChatGPT said:

Here’s a copy‑pasteable master prompt you can give to your LLM (“Q”) to produce Step 1: Canonical Graph Schema. It tells Q exactly what to output (nodes, edges, properties, IDs, DDL/upserts), how to name things, and includes acceptance criteria.

Prompt to Q — Build Canonical Graph Schema for AWS Network/Security Inventory

Role: You are a senior cloud graph modeler. Create a canonical, implementation‑ready property‑graph schema for visualizing AWS networking & security reachability across multi‑account, multi‑region environments.

Inputs / Context

I have enriched inventory for AWS resources (from Resource Explorer + Describe* calls) in S3/Parquet with Glue/Athena views.

I will load this data into a graph to compute network paths and render diagrams (Reachability‑like).

I need a schema that works with either Amazon Neptune (openCypher), Neo4j (Cypher), or in‑memory NetworkX.

Goal

Produce a canonical graph schema with:

Node types + required properties (strongly typed),

Edge types + direction + properties,

ID strategy (compound keys: account_id, region, natural IDs),

Normalization guidance (when to store rules as nodes vs edge props),

Ready‑to‑use artifacts:

(A) JSON Schema for nodes & edges (validation),

(B) Cypher upsert templates (MERGE statements) for loader code,

(C) Minimal NetworkX construction hints (Python type hints).

Scope (must cover at least)

VPC, Subnet, RouteTable, Route, InternetGateway, NatGateway, VpcPeering

TransitGateway, TgwAttachment, TgwRouteTable, TgwRoute, TGW associations/propagations

NetworkAcl + NaclRule

SecurityGroup + SgRule (including SG‑to‑SG references & PrefixLists)

ENI, EC2 Instance

VpcEndpoint (interface & gateway) and its SGs

(Optional but nice): ALB/NLB, TargetGroup, EKSCluster, PodENI

Required Model Decisions

Node vs Edge props:

Treat Route, SgRule, NaclRule as edge properties by default for runtime speed; include an alternative where they are nodes if graph DB requires.

Directionality:

Edges point from source to target in the traffic sense where applicable (e.g., Subnet -> RouteTable, RouteTable -HAS_ROUTE-> Target).

Time & change:

Include updated_at and state_hash on all nodes; edges should have an source_snapshot_at where feasible.

Naming & Types

Use camelCase for property names; explicit types (string, boolean, enum, ipCidr, int, list<string>, map<string,string>).

Enumerations for: route.targetType ∈ {IGW,NATGW,ENI,TGW_ATTACH,PCX,VPCE_IF,VPCE_GW,VGW,LOCAL,BLACKHOLE}; sgRule.dir ∈ {ingress,egress}; proto ∈ {tcp,udp,icmp,all}.

IPs/CIDRs must be typed as ipCidr or ipAddress in JSON Schema.

Output Format (produce all three sections)
Section 1 — Canon schema (human‑readable)

A concise table/list of Node types with required properties.

A concise table/list of Edge types with direction and properties.

Include ID strategy per node and per edge (e.g., id = "{account}:{region}:{type}:{naturalId}").

Specify which edges are derived (e.g., TGW attach → RT via association; TGW path eligibility via propagation).

Section 2 — JSON Schemas

Provide two JSON Schema documents:

NodeSchema.json (a union via oneOf for each node label)

EdgeSchema.json (a union via oneOf for each edge type)
Each must define:

type, id, accountId, region, properties{...}, labels[string[]] for nodes

type, fromId, toId, properties{...} for edges

Patterns/regex for ARNs and IDs where known (e.g., ^eni-[0-9a-f]+$)

Section 3 — Loader templates (ready to paste)

Cypher MERGE templates for each major node/edge type (Neptune openCypher compatible).

Example: Subnet, RouteTable, HAS_ROUTE, ENI -IN_SUBNET-> Subnet, ENI -USES-> SecurityGroup, Subnet -ASSOCIATED_WITH-> RouteTable, TgwAttachment -ASSOCIATED_WITH-> TgwRouteTable, TgwRouteTable -HAS_ROUTE-> (route as edge props), etc.

NetworkX hints

Python type hints for a minimal add_node/add_edge function per type, and attribute dict layouts.

Acceptance Criteria (Q must satisfy)

Covers all scope items above with required properties sufficient for L3 routing and L4 filtering.

Explicit edge directions and property names are consistent across sections.

Provides ID patterns and compound keys that avoid collisions across accounts/regions.

Cypher upserts are idempotent (use MERGE on stable keys).

JSON Schema validates property types (CIDRs, booleans, enums).

Includes notes for alternate modeling where rules are nodes.

Short worked example: show the nodes/edges that would be created for:

One VPC with 2 subnets, 1 route table (local + default to NATGW), 1 ENI with 1 SG (ingress 443 from SG‑X), and a TGW attachment associated to a TGW route table with a route to another attachment.

Example property sets (for Q to include as defaults)

Subnet: id, vpcId, az, cidr, isPrivate:boolean, routeTableId, naclId, tags{}

SecurityGroup: id, vpcId, tags{}, ruleCount:int

SgRule (edge props): dir, proto, portMin, portMax, srcKind:{cidr,sg,prefixList}, srcValue, description

Route (edge props): destCidr, targetType, targetId, state:{active,blackhole}, routeTableId

TgwAttachment: id, tgwId, vpcId, subnetIds[], accountId, region

TgwRoute (edge props): destCidr, targetAttachmentId, blackhole:boolean

Non‑Goals (to keep Q focused)

No L7 app modeling, no IAM policy evaluation, no Kubernetes policy modeling (yet).

Do not generate ingestion code or queries—only the schema and upsert templates.

Security group changes:

What if I widen ingress to 0.0.0.0/0 ‚Äî what assets are now exposed?

GuardDuty suppression:

3. SRE & Ops

High-availability what-if:

What if a NAT Gateway in one AZ is removed ‚Äî does egress still work for all subnets?

Scaling & limits:

What if traffic spikes 10√ó ‚Äî do ASGs/EKS nodes scale before API rate limits hit?

What if we cross service quotas (ENIs per AZ, TGW route table entries)?

Chaos test planning:

What if I kill all EC2s in subnet-B ‚Äî does the ALB still pass health checks?

Operational dependency graph:

What if CloudWatch Logs is throttled ‚Äî which pipelines and apps silently fail?

4. Cloud Platform / Governance

Cost what-if:

What if I enable VPC Flow Logs on all VPCs ‚Äî how much will it cost?

What if I turn on GuardDuty org-wide ‚Äî monthly delta?

Region migration:

What if we move this workload to eu-west-1 ‚Äî are all services (KMS, RDS, Lambda layers) available?

Org SCP change:

What if I deny ec2:CreateVpcPeeringConnection ‚Äî which teams‚Äô IaC will fail?

Centralization:

What if we centralize NAT GWs ‚Äî which teams‚Äô egress patterns break?

5. GIS / Geo-Aware Teams

Data residency:

What if I enable cross-region replication to us-east-1 ‚Äî does it break GDPR?

Edge latency:

What if CloudFront POP in India goes down ‚Äî what is latency impact for APAC users?

Route 53 traffic policy:

What if I change weighted routing from 50/50 to 100/0 ‚Äî how does it shift user traffic maps?

GeoIP firewall rules:

What if I block all of China in WAF ‚Äî which user base % is denied?

6. Application & Dev Teams

EKS what-if:

What if I change endpointPublicAccess=true ‚Äî do devs gain/loss cluster access?

What if I upgrade EKS 1.24‚Üí1.29 ‚Äî which API versions/CRDs break?

RDS/DB what-if:

What if I flip from Single-AZ to Multi-AZ ‚Äî downtime?

What if I enable global database ‚Äî replication lag + failover paths?

Lambda execution env:

What if I attach this VPC config ‚Äî do cold starts increase due to ENI attach?

Queue/topic:

What if I widen SNS topic policy ‚Äî which accounts can publish?

Secrets Manager:

What if I rotate this secret ‚Äî which Lambda/ECS tasks break?

üõ†Ô∏è How to Make These Work in Your Tool

Input normalization:

Already have nodes/edges; add tags, accounts, regions, compliance metadata as node props.

This powers policy checks (prod‚Üídev, PCI workloads, etc.).

Scenario templates:

Define YAML ‚Äúwhat-if packs‚Äù for each domain. Example:

- id: s3-public-policy
  question: "What if bucket policy allows *:s3:GetObject from *?"
  check: s3PolicyAnalyzer
  risk: "Public data exposure"


Each pack maps to a handler (graph query, IAM analyzer, or LLM reasoning).

Execution engine:

For each what-if, extract relevant subgraph ‚Üí feed to Bedrock + deterministic checker.

Return decision, evidence, riskLevel.

Consumption surfaces:

Pre-merge checks in Terraform CI/CD.

On-demand queries via CLI/API.

Scheduled compliance sweeps (nightly drift detection).

Portal dashboards (policy violations, cost diffs, geo impact maps).

‚úÖ Immediate Next Steps

Pick 2‚Äì3 what-if scenarios per persona (Networking, Security, DevOps).

Implement as YAML rules + graph queries ‚Üí call your Bedrock reachability/explainer.

Add to CLI:

reach what-if s3-public-policy --bucket my-data
reach what-if tgw-attach --src-vpc vpc-a --dst-vpc vpc-b
reach what-if eks-public-access --cluster dev-cluster

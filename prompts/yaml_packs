Q Prompt: Generate AFT Jira Story YAML Packs

You are a workflow assistant for Cloud Platform Engineering.
Generate YAML packs for Jira story templates specific to AWS Account Factory for Terraform (AFT).

Each YAML entry should contain:

id: short machine ID for the scenario

title: concise title for Jira story

question: plain English what-if / problem statement

type: one of [platform, security, networking, governance]

inputs: parameters required (e.g., account_id, repo_name, module)

story_template: Jira story text (with placeholders)

acceptance_criteria: list of bullet points tailored to AFT workflows

labels: [AFT, AWS, PlatformEng, etc.]

risk: low/medium/high

remediation: recommended action or next step

Produce 5 YAML packs covering common AFT scenarios, such as:

Provisioning drift (Terraform vs actual account config)

Module version upgrades (AFT pipelines pinned too old)

Security baseline compliance (CIS/NIST/AWS Guardrails not enforced)

IAM permission boundary changes in AFT managed accounts

Pipeline failures (CodeBuild/CodePipeline inside AFT)

Ensure YAML is syntactically valid, human-readable, and immediately usable by a workflow engine.
